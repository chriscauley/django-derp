# django-derp - A develop driven test client

Django-derp is a python client used to create tests from live data. You first specify a list of urls, users, and other functions to test. Running `CANNONICAL=1 derp` then runs all tests and caches the results of each url. Then, after changing some code, running `derp` will re-run all the tests and compare them to the cached values. The goal is to quickly verify that changes in code have no unforseen consequences.
