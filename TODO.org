* pip deploy
** create a cli.py that can be symlinked to /user/bin/derp
** add to pip
* arguments
** probably call it test_derp or herp instead of run_derp
** config should have sub tasks in addition to main task so that `./manage.py run_derp leaderboard`
   will only test the leaderboard urls
** maybe have a `--user` flag that matches the email so that it can selectively run one user
** ibid for url flag
